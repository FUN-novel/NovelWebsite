        <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">The Grand Debut</b> <br><br>
            Life in Saintara continued as usual, with everyone engrossed in their daily tasks—including Saintana and Deaus. Their conversations were minimal, limited to updates and instructions regarding the upcoming debut preparations. Deaus found himself unable to initiate any personal discussions with her. Saintana, as always, remained cold and unreadable, as if nothing had ever happened.  

Yet, for the first time, Deaus felt a faint sense of pity and sympathy for her. He muttered under his breath, <br><i style="color: pink;">"If only she could open up to me, even a little..."  </i><br>

Before he could dwell on his thoughts, a loud voice cut through the air.  
<br>
<i style="color: pink;">"Deaus! Why are you so clumsy today? This isn’t like you!"  </i>
<br>
Snapping back to reality, Deaus sighed and resumed his work. He realized he couldn’t afford to let his emotions interfere with his duties—especially when they were assigned directly by Saintana.

        <b style="font-size: 2em;">The Missing Heir</b>  
        <br><br>
        The entire royal family of Quilientia was originally expected to arrive a week before the banquet. However, Jayranio’s rebellious nature had reached its peak. He refused to make an early appearance, agreeing only under one condition—that he would arrive in the capital on the banquet night itself. Since no one wanted unnecessary conflict, they reluctantly accepted his terms.  
        
        Saintana had been designated to escort Jayranio during the debut’s opening ceremony. But now, with his absence, she would have to address him from the stage and formally introduce him during her speech. She found this irresponsibility utterly unacceptable.  </p>

    <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">The Brewing Conspiracy</b>  
<br><br>
        Meanwhile, Musol had set his plans into motion. He had been busy spreading his misleading information, filling the ears of as many nobles as possible before the grand event. To secure their support, he made numerous promises, his eyes gleaming with unchecked greed. However, the deeper he sank into his schemes, the more he lost sight of reality.  </p>

<div style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bolder;">The First Day of the Debut</div>  

<div>
    <p>The grand Crystal Hall in the capital was teeming with distinguished guests. Influential families and high-ranking officials entered one by one, greeting each other and discussing business opportunities. Some were introducing their children to potential allies, hoping to forge powerful connections. The banquet was set to be one of the most extravagant affairs in recent history, with massive financial investments from multiple empires.  
<br><br>
        The entire hall sparkled like a living jewel. Fire shows, magical displays, juggling acts, floral dances, and breathtaking water performances created a dazzling atmosphere.  
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/juggling.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div>
    <p>Then, the moment arrived. The royal family of Quilientia made their entrance.  
<br><br>
        A grand announcement echoed across the hall:  
        <br><br>
        <b style="color: greenyellow;">"The Emperor of Quilientia, Himinnsa, Empress Esteria, and the heir, Jayranio, have arrived!"</b>  
        <br><br>
        All eyes turned toward the young heir—the main figure of the debut. The noble ladies, particularly the unmarried ones, eagerly showcased their beauty and elegance, hoping to capture his attention.  
        <br><br>
        Jayranio's golden hair gleamed like molten gold under the chandelier lights, his sharp, eagle-like gaze exuding an air of authority. His striking physique and commanding presence left many women in awe.  
        <br>
        Dressed in a royal purple suit embedded with precious jewels, Jayranio stood out effortlessly. This shade of purple was exclusively reserved for him, Taintai IX, and Saintana—a symbol of the power they held. His regal appearance alone was enough to leave an impression, as if he had stepped straight out of the pages of a novel.  </p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Yet, despite all the grandeur, the debut could not officially begin.  
<br><br>
        Saintana had yet to arrive.  
        <br><br>
        Jayranio scowled, irritation flashing across his face.  
        <br>
        <b style="color: greenyellow;">"It’s my banquet, and yet everyone is waiting for this so-called Saintana like she’s the main character. I’m just here to flaunt her authority,"</b><br> he muttered under his breath. Annoyed, he grabbed a drink and took a sip.  <br>
        
        Just then, Deaus stepped forward with his usual composed demeanor. He stood before Jayranio, his expression neutral yet respectful.  
        <br>
        <b style="color: aqua;">"I humbly welcome you, teacher,"</b><br> Deaus said, his voice steady.  
        <br>
        Jayranio simply smirked, unfazed by the title.  
        <br>
        During Deaus' time in Quilientia, Jayranio had been his sword-fighting instructor, even when his memory was gone. The lessons had been intense, often pushing Deaus to his limits. He had been more than just a teacher—he had been a figure of discipline and strength, someone who commanded respect even in his lost state.  
        
        <b style="color: greenyellow;">"You’ve improved, haven’t you?"</b> <br>Jayranio remarked, eyeing Deaus briefly before taking another sip of his drink.  
        <br><br>
        Deaus bowed his head slightly.
        <b style="color: aqua;"> "I had no choice but to live up to the expectations you set for me."  </b>
        <br><br>
        Jayranio let out a short chuckle but said nothing more.  
        <br>
        Himinnsa, Jayranio’s father, cast a sharp glance toward his son.  
        <br>
        <b style="color: red;">"Don’t cause any trouble. And above all, show respect,"</b> he warned before moving off to greet the other emperors.  
        <br><br>
        Jayranio exhaled sharply, biting back an irritated response. Moments later, a swarm of noble ladies surrounded him, eager to introduce themselves, while young lords attempted to build connections with him. His disinterest was evident, but he endured the formalities.  
        </p>

<div>
    <p>A woman with striking red hair and a delicate pink gown stepped forward.  
<br>
        <i style="color: coral;">"It’s a pleasure to meet you, my lord. I am Princess Amelia from the Flora Empire,"</i> she said gracefully.  
        <br><br>
        Jayranio offered a polite nod, hoping to end the conversation swiftly. However, the surrounding nobles continued their chatter.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: coral;">"My lord, you must be nervous to meet Lady Saintana, right?"</i> one of the ladies teased.  
        <br><br>
        The mere mention of her name made Jayranio’s blood boil.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: greenyellow;">"Again with this Saintana,"</i> he gritted his teeth.  
        <br><br>
        Another noble chimed in, <i style="color: coral;">"I’m excited to see what she wears this time."</i>  
        <br><br>
        A young woman with chestnut-brown hair added, <br> <i style="color: coral;">"Every time Lady Saintana wears something, it becomes the latest trend."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Another lady sighed,<br> <i style="color: red;">"Her silver hair and those captivating purple eyes make her stand out so much... I can’t help but be jealous. If only I had such beauty." </i> 
        <br><br>
        Jayranio froze.  
        <br>
        His entire body tensed.  
        <br><br>
        <i><b style="color: greenyellow;">"Silver hair? Purple eyes?"</b></i>  
        <br>
        His sharp gaze snapped toward the woman who had spoken.  
        <br><br>
        <i><b style="color: greenyellow;">"What did you say?" </b></i>he demanded, his voice low but firm.  
        <br><br>
        A young nobleman beside him chuckled. <br> <i><b style="color:cornflowerblue;">"You don’t know, my lord? Lady Saintana’s silver hair and purple eyes are among her most renowned features! Not to mention, her beauty is unmatched. However, her cold and distant nature has scared away every potential suitor who has tried to pursue her."  </b></i>
        <br><br>
        Jayranio’s heart pounded in his chest.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: green;">"Silver hair... purple eyes... rare beauty," </i>he murmured, his breath uneven.  
        <br><br>
        His mind raced, trying to suppress a sudden, overwhelming realization.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: yellow;">"No... it’s impossible. My Milli? Could Saintana know something about her?"  
            <br>
            "Maybe she’s a relative... or someone connected to Milli."  
            <br>
            "I need to speak with her. I need a private audience with her tomorrow—no matter what."</i>  
        <br><br>
        For the first time, Jayranio felt a desperation he had never known before.  
        <br>
        The very woman he had despised mere moments ago might hold the answers he had been searching for all these years.</p>
