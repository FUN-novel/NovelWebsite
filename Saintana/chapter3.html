    <p>Saintana's routine was as regimented as the empire she helped govern. Mornings began with grueling training at the Knight's Ground, followed by a whirlwind of meetings with officials and a mountain of administrative duties. Afternoons were reserved for horseback riding, a chance to survey her vast domain and ponder the intricacies of the ten empires she ruled. Evenings culminated in a formal dinner with Emperor Taintai IX, a man whose amusement was as sharp as his wit.

        "No interest in marriage, Saintana?" Taintai inquired one evening, his gaze a playful challenge.
        
        Saintana, her silver hair a stark contrast against the crimson velvet of her gown, met his gaze. "No one born here is my equal, Your Majesty," she replied, her voice devoid of bitterness, yet carrying the weight of a profound solitude.
        
        Taintai chuckled, a low rumble that sent shivers down the spines of the other courtiers. "You are quite right," he conceded, his eyes twinkling. "No man could possibly be a match for you."
        
        A heavy silence descended upon the dining hall, broken only by the soft clinking of silverware. Saintana, feeling a suffocating sense of isolation, excused herself and retreated to her chambers.
        
        Alone, the weight of her solitude pressed down on her. How could she, born with extraordinary abilities, ever truly belong? How could she experience the simple joys of life, the laughter of children, the warmth of a loving family?
        
        She pulled out a worn leather diary from a secret drawer. Its title, "My 100 Lifes of Emptiness," sent a shiver down her spine. As she turned the aged pages, memories, vivid and fragmented, flooded her mind. A family... a young girl with eyes like wildflowers... a sudden, suffocating silence...
        
        She gasped, her breath shallow, as the weight of the memory pressed down on her. Whispering softly into the quiet of the room, she muttered, "I was dead, but why am I not at peace?" The words hung in the air, unraveling a truth she had long suppressed: the girl in her vision was herself. Yet, the girl had brown hair, not the silver strands she now bore. The revelation struck herâ€”it confirmed that she had died and been reborn in another body, in another universe.
        
        The weight of this realization threatened to overwhelm her, but exhaustion took hold. Saintana collapsed onto the couch, the diary slipping from her grasp onto the floor. Her thoughts, jumbled and incomplete, remained unassembled as she drifted into sleep. For once, her slumber was peaceful, untroubled by the nightmares that had haunted her for so long.
