    <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">Night 3 of the Debut</b><br><br>
        The final night of the grand debut was dedicated to the vibrant night market, where the streets bustled with laughter, music, and the scent of sizzling delicacies. Festivities enveloped the empire, with nobles and commoners alike indulging in the rare spectacle of celebration. However, amidst the lively crowd, two figures chose a different path‚ÄîJayranio and Saintana.
        <br><br>
        Desiring a moment of solitude away from prying eyes, they ventured towards the mountain where their love had first bloomed. The once-scorched land, though marred by the past, held a sacred place in their hearts. Beneath the vast expanse of the night sky, they lay side by side, gazing at the constellations that had silently witnessed their journey.
        <br><br>
        With nothing but the whispers of the wind around them, they spoke freely‚Äîof dreams, of memories, of the trials that had led them here. Time seemed to stand still as they lost themselves in each other‚Äôs words, their hearts lighter than they had been in years. Neither of them realized when sleep gently stole them away, wrapped in the warmth of the moment.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the Heart of the Festival <br><br>
        True to his word, Deaus accompanied Princess Amelia through the bustling market, fulfilling his promise to her. Despite his usual stoic demeanor, he instinctively took care of her like a knight, guiding her through the crowds and ensuring she experienced the festival to its fullest.
        <br><br>
        They spoke at length‚Äîabout their families, their childhoods, the worlds they had come from. For Amelia, it was a night of freedom she had never known, indulging in street foods she had only heard about, marveling at the simple joys that had always been beyond her reach.
        <br><br>
        For Deaus, it was something even more profound. After years of restraint, he found himself at ease, speaking without filters, laughing without thought. Amelia's presence intrigued him in ways he hadn‚Äôt expected, and for the first time in a long while, he allowed himself to simply exist without the weight of duty pressing upon his shoulders.
        <br><br>
        The festival came to an end with hearts lightened, bonds deepened, and a newfound understanding blooming between them.</p>

    <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">The Next Morning ‚Äì Parting Ways</b> <br><br>
        As dawn broke, the grand halls of Saintara were filled with farewells. Delegates from across the lands began their return to their respective territories, the echoes of the debut lingering in their minds. However, for Saintana and Jayranio, a more personal farewell awaited.
        <br><br>
        After ten years apart, separating once more was a burden neither wanted to bear. Yet, duty called.
        <br><br>
        Saintana remained in Saintara, ensuring a smooth transition of power. Though many would have fought to keep her, none dared challenge her decision‚Äîshe had given more to the empire than any other, and her retirement was both deserved and undisputed.
        <br><br>
        Jayranio, on the other hand, returned to Quilientia, stepping into his newly inherited responsibilities as Emperor. Though ruling an empire was a daunting task, he carried the confidence of a man who had finally found his purpose.

    <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">A Union Beyond Borders</b><br><br>
        As the wedding day approached, a private tea gathering was arranged with their closest companions‚ÄîSuren, Rimika, Deaus, and, to everyone‚Äôs surprise, Princess Amelia. What was even more shocking, however, was the sight of Deaus and Amelia seated together, exchanging shy glances and hidden smiles.
        <br><br>
        Curious gazes turned to them, demanding an explanation, and it was then revealed that Deaus, in an unexpected turn of events, had confessed his feelings to Amelia just days prior. Not one to waste time, he had sought the approval of the Emperor of the Flora Empire, which was swiftly granted‚Äîafter all, as the third princess with no political ties, Amelia had the freedom to choose her own path.
        <br><br>
        The revelation brought joy and teasing alike, marking yet another unexpected love story born from this fateful gathering.</p>

    <p>Finally, the long-awaited day arrived.
<br><br>
        Jayranio and Saintana, known now as Milli and Jayranio, exchanged vows in the presence of the greatest powers across the continent. Their love story, forged in fire and fate, became a symbol of unity and resilience.
        <br>
        The wedding was declared an annual festival, a permanent celebration of love, power, and the trials that shaped them.
        <br>
        Together, Jayranio and Saintana ruled Quilientia, side by side‚Äînot just as Emperor and Empress, but as two souls who had fought against fate and won.
        <br><br>
        And so, their journey continued‚Äînot an ending, but the beginning of a new era.
    
    <br><br>ON THE WEDDING NIGHT <br><br>
<i style="color: gold;">"I never imagined we'd come this far,"</i><br> Saintana whispered, gazing at the glowing city before them.
<br>
    Jayranio pulled her close, pressing a kiss to her temple. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"And yet, this is just the beginning."</i>
    <br><br>
    As the winds carried their laughter into the night, the story of Saintana and Jayranio became legend‚Äîone that would be told for generations to come.</p>
