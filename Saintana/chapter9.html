            <b style="font-size: 2em;">Quilientia Empire – The Empire of Aura Masters</b>  <br><br>

            Quilientia was bustling with preparations to welcome its heir and depart for the capital, Saintara, for his grand debut. The heir of Quilientia, <i style="color:khaki;">Jayranio</i>, had gone missing for four years. When he returned, he was gravely injured, and the shock of his ordeal sent him into a <b style="color: red;">coma</b> that lasted seven years.  
            <br><br>
            When he finally awoke, his mind was unstable, and he had lost all memories of his past. He only retained knowledge—battle strategies, literature, and sword techniques—but neither his identity nor any recollection of his life. His body recovered within a year, but what truly shocked everyone was his extraordinary swordsmanship. His skills were beyond anything expected, impossible for someone without intense training in his early years. It was nothing short of a miracle, and while it made the people of Quilientia proud, it also raised questions— <i style="color: greenyellow;">who had trained him during those lost years? </i> 
            <br><br>
            Due to his unstable condition, the empire had refrained from publicly announcing his return to other nations. Even after he woke up, they kept his existence hidden, waiting for him to recover fully and reclaim his rightful place as Quilientia’s ruler. Fortunately, after seven years in a coma and two years and six months of wandering with lost memories, <i style="color: aqua;">he finally remembered everything.</i>  </p>
            <img src="./assets/wounded.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

<div>
    <p>But the moment he regained his memories, those near him witnessed something chilling—a look of loathing in his eyes. Loathing for his family. Loathing for the officials standing before him.  
        <br><br>
        The empire decided that his official debut into high society should be orchestrated carefully, with the support of Saintana. A politically influential figure like her would make his standing among the heirs and nobles of other empires much stronger.  
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-size: 25px;">A Hectic Day in Quilientia</b>  
        <br><br>
        The entire empire was in a frenzy, but no one was struggling more than <i style="color: khaki;">Suren</i>, the personal aide to Quilientia’s emperor. His task? Preparing Jayranio for his debut.  
        <br><br>
        Suren was responsible for educating him about Saintara, Quilientia’s political affairs, and most importantly—Saintana. The empire seemed keen on using Jayranio to forge a close connection with the cold-hearted and untouchable Saintana, possibly through a marriage alliance.  
        <br><br>
        But there was one problem.  
        <br>
        Jayranio was impossible to handle.  
        <br><br>
        From the moment he regained his memory, he was always angry. He refused to be controlled, never spoke to his family, and trained with his sword relentlessly, as if possessed.  </p>
        <img src="./assets/auraaide.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<div>
    <p>And then there was one more thing.  
        <br>
        Something that no one understood.  
        <br><br>
        He was obsessed with carving wooden hearts, each engraved with the same name— <b style="color: red;">Milli</b>.  
        <br><br>
        His room was filled with them. Piles of intricately carved wooden pieces, all bearing that one name- "Milli". 
        <br>
        At one point, gathering his composure, he had demanded his father to find Milli for him.  
        
        But his father had cut him off coldly.  
        
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: aqua;">"Immature. That’s what you are, Jayranio. Immature and unworthy of being the heir." </i> 
        <br><br>
        The only reason he was allowed to reclaim his position was because his elder brother had died in an accident.  </p>
        <img src="./assets/heartroom.jpg" alt="">
</div>

  

<div>
    <p>Suren tried explaining how Saintana had changed the political landscape of Saintara and how crucial it was for him to understand her role. But Jayranio wasn’t interested. <br><br>  

        Not one bit.  
        <br><br>
        Frustrated, he shouted and shattered a vase against the wall.  
        <br><br>
        <i style="color:lightcoral;">"I don’t give a damn about this so-called great madwoman saint or whatever she is!" he roared. "I don’t care how legendary she is or what she looks like. I know exactly what you’re trying to do! But listen well—there is only one person I want in my life, and that is my Milli!" </i> 
        <br><br>
        His chest heaved with rage as he pointed a finger at Suren.  
        <br><br>
       <i style="color: lightcoral;"> "I stayed silent and played along with this ridiculous debut because I know they’ll allow me some official duties after it's over. That’s the only reason I’m tolerating this nonsense. But once this charade ends, I will search every empire myself until I find Milli!"  </i>
        <br><br>
        He gritted his teeth, his voice dark and menacing.  
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: lightcoral;">"And if anyone dares stand in my way—"  </i>
        <br>
        His aura flared dangerously, a suffocating pressure filling the room.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: lightcoral;">"I will destroy them."</i>  
        
       <br><br> 
        
        No one understood his obsession with this mysterious girl named Milli.  
        <br>
        The emperor had strictly forbidden anyone from uttering her name or investigating her. The mere mention of Milli in the palace could lead to severe punishment.  
        <br>
        Perhaps it was because of Jayranio’s rebellious nature, or maybe it was something deeper—something the emperor himself feared.  
        <br>
        Whatever the reason, Suren didn’t dare ask.  
        <br>
        But as he watched Jayranio pick up a wooden log and begin carving Milli’s name once again, he sighed in defeat.  
        <br>
        <b style="color: greenyellow;">"This is pointless."  </b>
        <br>
        Jayranio had no interest in politics, in alliances, in the grand schemes of empires.  
        <br>
        Suren decided there was no use forcing him.  
        <br>
        At the very least, he would make sure Jayranio looked the part—teach him proper etiquette, get him dressed in the finest garments, and make sure he survived these three days of debut without incident.  
        <br>
        And somehow, in an unexpected twist, Jayranio agreed to learn the debut dance.  
        <br>
        Perhaps this was Suren’s only victory.  
        <br><br>
        <b style="color: greenyellow;">For now.</b>  </p>

<div>
    <p>
        <b style="font-size: 2em;">Meanwhile, in Saintara… </b> 
<br><br>
        A deathly silence filled Saintana’s chambers.  
        <br><br>
        The air was thick with unspoken rage.  
        <br><br>
        From the shadows of the room, a single pair of piercing eyes glared down at Deaus.  
        <br><br>
        Saintana’s eyes.  
        <br><br>
        Her expression was unreadable, but the aura around her was suffocating. Lethal.  
        <br><br>
        Deaus felt his throat tighten.  
        <br><br>
        He had seen Saintana’s anger before. But this…  
        <br><br>
        This was different.  
        <br><br>
        She wasn’t just angry.  
        <br>
        She was seething.  
        <br><br>
        And Deaus knew, with absolute certainty—  
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: red;">He might not make it out of this room alive</i>.</p>
