        <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">In the Meeting Chambers of Tanintai IX</b>
<br><br>
            As they entered the room, Jayranio greeted Tanintai with a respectful tone. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"Greetings, my Lord. I am Jayranio, Crown Prince of Quilientia."</i>
            <br><br>
            Tanintai gestured for them to take a seat on the sofa. Jayranio, though nervous, was more concerned for Saintana than himself. He leaned in and whispered in her ear, <br><i style="color: gold;">"Don't worry, Milli. I'm here."</i>
            <br><br>
            Seeing him worried for her warmed Saintana's heart. As she smiled, Tanintai smirked and spoke in a sarcastic tone. <br> <i style="color: gray;"> "I never thought I'd live to see the day you’d smile like a fool."</i>
            <br><br>
            Rimika coughed, trying to suppress his amusement. Saintana raised an eyebrow.
            <br>
            Tanintai sighed. <br> <i style="color: gray;">"Can you please let me live one more day in peace? You've been shocking me non-stop since yesterday."</i>
            <br><br>
            Ignoring him, Saintana playfully grabbed Jayranio in a headlock with her elbow. Jayranio’s heart nearly skipped a beat, especially in the presence of the Emperor.
            <br><br>
            Tanintai sighed again. <br> <i style="color: gray;">"I’m sorry, but I’m far too old to take an interest in young men. And for the record, I prefer ladies."</i>
            <br><br>
            Jayranio was stunned at the informal humor from Tanintai, but Rimika remained unfazed, as if this was nothing new.

<div>
    <p>Saintana grinned. <br><i style="color: aquamarine;"> "You don’t need to worry. I'll handle my own mess. And now, I have even more reason to do so—I have to protect my husband!"</i>
<br><br>
        Tanintai choked on his tea, blushing, while Rimika nearly lost his balance in shock. Meanwhile, Jayranio turned as red as a tomato, overwhelmed by secondhand embarrassment.
        <br><br>
        Tanintai cleared his throat. <br><i style="color: gray;">"I suppose I’m entitled to an explanation for yesterday’s events. And, young man, what exactly made you fall for such an icy girl?"</i>
        <br><br>
        Jayranio pouted. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"Icy? She’s the warmest person in the entire world."</i>
        <br><br>
        Tanintai regretted asking that question—it was clear he was dealing with two hopeless romantics.
        <br><br>
        
        </p>

<div>
    <p>Saintana proceeded to explain the events of ten years ago and her relationship with Jayranio, carefully omitting the part about her past lives, as it wasn’t necessary for the discussion.
        <br><br>
        Tanintai frowned. <br><i style="color: gray;"> "A fire? Just like that?"</i>
        <br>
        Jayranio turned to Saintana, as if contemplating whether to reveal something. Finally, he spoke. <br><br> <i style="color: gold;">"Maybe I can fill in some missing pieces of this story—things even Milli doesn’t know."</i>
        <br>
        Saintana gasped, caught off guard.
        <br>
        Jayranio took a deep breath. 
      <br>  <i style="color: gold;">"When Milli first found me in the mountains, I was actually being hunted—by my own people."</i>
        <br><br>
        Tanintai’s expression darkened.
        <br>
        Jayranio continued. <br><i style="color: gold;">"I was ten years younger than my elder brother, yet my aura was stronger than his, even at the age of fourteen. That made him insecure—afraid I’d claim his throne one day. So, to eliminate the risk, he orchestrated an assassination attempt. I managed to escape but was gravely wounded while hiding in an abandoned mountain. That’s when I saw Milli—her silver hair shimmering in the moonlight, her beautiful ey—"
        </i> <br><br>
        Tanintai interrupted. <br> <i style="color: gray;">"Get to the point! We all know what she looks like, lovebird."</i>
        <br>
        Saintana blushed.</p>
        <img src="./assets/powercouple2.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div>
    <p>Jayranio chuckled and continued. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"Since I was unwelcome in my own homeland, I forced Milli to let me stay with her. But, in time, I fell in love with her. Four years later, just before I proposed, my whereabouts were discovered. My elder brother had died in an accident, leaving me as the only heir. My father, selfish as ever, wanted me back."</i>
<br><br>
        He paused, his jaw tightening. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"Of course, I refused to return to that rotten place, but they didn’t give up. They continued to track me down—until they found the reason I was staying: Milli. They planned to eliminate her by setting the mountains on fire while I was away. But that night, I was with her, proposing. They never expected me to be there. The fire broke out, trapping us both. We were severely injured, and I lost consciousness for five years. When I woke up, I had no memories of her."</i>
        <br><br>
        His fists clenched. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"And I know it was my father’s doing. I nearly lost my Milli."
        </i><br><br>
        Saintana’s eyes burned with rage, her entire body trembling. Her aura became suffocating, thick with the promise of bloodshed. She had never been this close to losing control.
        <br><br>
        Tanintai’s commanding voice cut through the tension. <br> <i style="color: gray;">"Contain yourself, Lady Saintana. Revenge is a game of the mind."</i>
        <br><br>
        But Saintana didn’t calm down. The room grew heavier, charged with her fury. Then, Jayranio reached for her hand. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"Calm down, I’m here—now and always."</i>
        <br><br>
        Miraculously, she relaxed instantly. That moment told both Tanintai and Rimika one undeniable truth: <br><br> <i style="color: red;">no one should ever dare to lay a hand on her 'puppy'—or rather, her 'hubby.'</i></p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Musol paced back and forth in his chamber, lost in thought. The events of the past day left him confused and frustrated. He whispered to himself, <i style="color: brown;">"Whatever it is, I won’t let you ruin my plans."</i>
<br><br>
        On the other side of the palace, Deaus had been invited for tea by Princess Amelia as a token of gratitude. As she was royalty, he had no right to refuse her invitation—or perhaps, he simply wanted to see her again.
        <br><br>
        He entered the sitting room and greeted her with a polite nod. <i style="color: aqua;">"Thank you for inviting me, Princess Amelia."</i>
        <br><br>
        She smiled. <i style="color: plum;">"The pleasure is mine."</i>
        <br><br>
        Deaus noticed something in her eyes—an interest, a curiosity about him.
        <br>
        Amelia leaned forward slightly. <i style="color: plum;">"I heard you won the tournament last year."</i>
        <br>
        He nodded, remaining quiet as always.
        <br>
        She chuckled. <br> <i style="color: plum;">"I take it you’re not much of a talker. Or... perhaps not with me?"</i>
        <br><br>
        For a moment, she lowered her gaze in shyness before continuing. <br><i style="color: plum;"> "Yesterday, I saw you watching Lady Saintana."</i>
        <br><br>
        That caught Deaus’s attention.
        <br><br>
        Amelia quickly added, <br> <i style="color: plum;">"Don’t take it the wrong way. It’s just... when you reached out to help me, I saw the moonlight reflecting in your eyes. I felt... something in my heart. I just..."</i>
        <br><br>
        Deaus understood what she was getting at. He had no right to let misunderstandings linger.
        <br><br>
        He finally spoke. <br> <i style="color: aqua;">"I only admire Lady Saintana. And Lord Jayranio is my teacher—he taught me everything I know about swordsmanship. I respect them both and wish for their happiness."</i>
        <br><br>
        Amelia searched his face. For a brief moment, she thought she saw a flicker of disappointment in his eyes, but somehow, that relieved her.
        <br><br>
        Then, with surprising boldness, she asked, <br> <i style="color: plum;">"Would you accompany me to the market tomorrow?"</i>
        <br>
        Her eyes sparkled with anticipation, and before he knew it, Deaus found himself agreeing.
