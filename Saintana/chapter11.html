             <b style="font-size: 2em;">The Conspiracy Against Saintana  </b>
<br><br>
            Musol was orchestrating a scheme behind the backs of the officials, regularly convening secret gatherings in commoners' beer clubs with a select group of nobles. These individuals hailed from Brannysp (Water Empire), Prinkta (Earth Empire), and Nitrostia (Flora Empire), along with a spy from Quilientia (Aura Master Empire). This marked their third clandestine meeting, and this time, a new player joined—a spy from Flyrint (Fire Empire), whom Musol had personally planted.  
            <br><br>
            The objective of these gatherings was singular—to gather as much information as possible on Saintana and use it to publicly humiliate and disgrace her on the grand debut of Jayranio, the heir of Quilientia. Each person in the room bore a grudge against Saintana, and their desperation to see her fall blinded them to reason. They clung to half-baked theories and never even bothered to verify their so-called "facts."  
            <br><br>
            The Quilientian spy shared exclusive intelligence regarding Jayranio. He revealed how the heir spent his days obsessively carving a single word—Milli—into wooden logs and how he had clashed bitterly with his father for refusing to aid in the search for this mysterious figure. Given how classified this information was, the spy had to bribe an extensive network of palace servants to acquire it. Quilientia was already suffering under the rule of its current emperor, making it easy to turn people against him for money.  
            <br><br>
            The moment Musol heard the name Milli, he reached into his pocket and retrieved a burnt wooden heart—one that also bore the same name. Connecting the dots, he analyzed the timeline, location, and circumstances surrounding Saintana’s arrival near the Saintara River ten years ago.

            <ul><i style="color: red;">Findings</i> 
                <li>Saintana was in the mountains during the great fire. </li>
                <li>Flyrint officials confirmed that the fire was unnatural.</li>
                <li>Jayranio was taken in by Quilientian ministers ten years ago, severely injured.  </li>
                <li>The timeline of Jayranio’s reappearance coincided with Saintana’s emergence.</li>
                <li>Jayranio is obsessed with the word Milli, which is presumed to be the name of a girl. </li>
                <li>Saintana has never disclosed her origins, claiming memory loss.</li>
                <li>Her body was covered in scars when she was found.  </li>
                <li>Traces of habitation were discovered in the mountains. </li>
                <li> Near this residence, a wooden heart with Milli carved into it was found, eerily similar to the ones in Jayranio’s room.  </li>
                <li>Despite years of search operations, Jayranio remained missing until suddenly being "found" under mysterious circumstances.  </li>

        <b style="color: red;">Their Conclusion  </b>
<br><br>
        "Saintana must be the cause of the mountain fire because she is capable of anything."  <br>
        <i style="color: palegreen;">(Author: Can you shut your inferiority complex down for a second?)  </i>
        <br><br>
        "She must have some connection with Jayranio and Milli. Judging by Jayranio’s hatred toward her, Saintana must have done something to Milli!"  
        <br><i style="color: palegreen;">(Author: Again, keep your ridiculous conclusions to yourself.)  </i>
        <br><br>
        "Milli was either killed or hidden by Saintana, who was likely Jayranio’s lover. The fire must have been her doing—to destroy their happy life in the mountains!"  <br>
        <i style="color: palegreen;">(Author: Can someone kindly slap Musol for me?)</i>  
        <br><br>
        Even among the conspirators, some harbored doubts about the logic of these assumptions. However, their limited intelligence failed them, and they could find no other explanations.  
        <br>
        Their plan was set. On the day of Jayranio’s debut, they would reveal Saintana’s supposed dark past before all the great empires and demand that Taintai IX, the emperor who always favored her, answer for his unwavering support.  
        <br><br>
        They even speculated about a possible indecent relationship between Saintana and Taintai IX.  
        <br><i style="color: palegreen;">(Author: Your brains are as empty as your souls.) </i> 
        <br><br>
        Musol let out a malicious laugh, and the entire group raised their beer mugs in celebration, believing they had taken their first step toward Saintana’s downfall.</p>
