        <p>Amidst the chaos unfolding in the grand hall, Deaus stood silently behind a pillar, observing everything. Aside from Saintana and Jayranio, he was the only one who truly understood Saintana's past and her deep connection with Jayranio. He whispered to himself,<br> 
            <i style="color: aqua;">"So, it was the teacher she had been waiting for all along? I should have realized it when I read those familiar lines in her diary—the same words the teacher once spoke to me."</i>
<br><br>
            He pondered,<br> <i style="color: aqua;">"Now that I connect all the dots, it was obvious—the teacher's unexpected swordsmanship, the golden-blonde hair described in the diary, the exact lines I once spoke to Lady Saintana during our sparring match, and the timing of her arrival coinciding with Jayranio's discovery in the woods. I was just reluctant to accept it!"</i>

    <p>For the first time, Saintana was at a complete loss. The banquet was in turmoil, and the attendees' expectant gazes demanded an explanation for the unfolding drama. She needed time. Calling Rimika over, she instructed him to announce the banquet's continuation the following day.
<br><br>
        Rimika proclaimed,<br><i style="color: khaki;"> "Given the circumstances, the banquet will resume tomorrow. All esteemed guests are kindly requested to remain within the domain until the debut is formally concluded."</i>
        <br><br>
        A wave of hushed murmurs spread across the hall, but Saintana paid no attention. Grabbing Jayranio's hand, she ran from the banquet hall like a child, seeking escape from the overwhelming eyes. Tanintai IX let out a long sigh, never expecting such a drastic turn of events. As the night deepened and exhaustion settled in, the guests retired to their chambers, and the banquet was officially postponed.

    <p>Meanwhile, as Deaus made his way to retire for the night, he spotted a young woman with striking red hair sitting on the ground in the garden. She was crying in pain, having twisted her ankle on her way back. Since she had ventured out alone without her attendants, she found herself stranded.
<br><br>
        Though weary from the night's events, Deaus couldn't simply leave her there. He extended his hand, and as she looked up, a fleeting thought crossed his mind: "What a cute face."
        <br><br>
        Shaking off his thoughts, he helped her up and offered to escort her back. She gladly accepted. Upon reaching her chambers, two maids rushed over, immediately scolding her for wandering off alone. Watching her flustered expression as she fended off their nagging made Deaus chuckle.
        <br><br>
        She turned to him with a polite smile. <br> <i style="color: plum;">"I apologize for the rudeness, Sir Deaus. I didn’t even introduce myself properly. I am Princess Amelia from the Flora Empire. Thanks to you, I was able to return safely."</i>
        <br><br>
        Deaus responded with a courteous nod before hastily departing, eager to finally rest.</p>

<div><p>Meanwhile, Saintana led Jayranio to her favorite place—a quiet refuge near the stables where she had spent countless stressful days talking to horses, rabbits, and lambs. She longed for a moment of peace away from the overwhelming scrutiny of the banquet hall.
    <br><br>
    Jayranio placed his hands on her shoulders, his voice calm and reassuring. "Relax. You're breathing too fast. Look at me—touch me. I’m real. There's no need to rush. Just take a deep breath."
    <br><br>
    It was only then that Saintana realized how heavily she was sweating from anxiety. Overcome with emotion, she hugged him tightly. <br><i style="color: red;">"Please, no more visions. This feels too real to be another illusion."</i>
    <br><br>
    Jayranio had also been anxious to see her again after all this time, but he knew her desperation far outweighed his own. She had lived through all her past lives alone, fighting endlessly, and had spent the last ten years struggling in the political battlefield. Compared to her, his recent months of regained memories and longing were nothing.
    <br><br>
    He smiled gently. <br> <i style="color: gold;">"This isn’t just a vision of your thoughts."</i>
    <br><br>
    But Saintana was still too shaken to believe it. Perhaps the last remnants of her willpower had finally spilled over.
    <br><br>
    Jayranio cupped her face gently, brushing his thumb over her cheek before leaning in. The moment their lips met, Saintana's breath hitched. The warmth of his touch was undeniable—solid, real. In that instant, she knew this was no dream. She lost herself in the moment, time seemingly frozen around them. As her breathing steadied, tears welled up in her eyes, and she sobbed like a child.
    <br><br>
    They sat together on the cool grass, their hands entwined in silence. Just as Jayranio prepared to speak, he noticed Saintana had dozed off against his shoulder. It seemed that, after finally confirming reality, she had allowed herself to relax completely.
    <br><br>
    He chuckled softly, brushing her hair aside as he whispered, <br> <i style="color: lightgreen;">"You're still as cute as ever."</i><br>May be he is the only one who could say cold Saintana cute. <br><br>

    <p>The night air was growing colder. Careful not to wake her, he carried her in his arms and brought her inside the sitting room. Normally, Saintana's heightened reflexes would have roused her at the slightest movement, but perhaps, after so long, she had finally found a sense of security. She remained fast asleep even as he laid her gently on the couch. Before long, both of them drifted into a peaceful slumber beside the warmth of the fireplace.
<br><br>
        By morning, Rimika and Suren were already in a heated argument about how the two troublemakers had made their work infinitely harder. The entire morning had been spent searching for them, as Tanintai IX awaited their presence in his private meeting chamber. To make matters worse, Suren had incurred the wrath of Emperor Himinnsa, as he was forbidden from meeting with Tanintai until Saintana and Jayranio were found.

<div>
    <p>After a long search, they finally discovered them in the sitting room, sleeping like children. Saintana rested on the couch, while Jayranio lay beside it, still holding her hand. Rimika was taken aback—it was rare to see Saintana sleeping this peacefully. However, duty called.
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: green;">"Wake up, both of you,"</i> Rimika ordered. <i style="color: green;">"Lord Tanintai is expecting you in his private chamber."</i></p>
        <img src="./assets/sleepmorning.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div>
    <p>Saintana stirred, her eyes instinctively searching for Jayranio. Seeing him still beside her restored her composure. They both freshened up in their respective rooms before requesting an audience with the Emperor of Saintara.
<br><br>
        Jayranio, however, was far from composed. Throughout the previous night, he had overheard rumors at the banquet—rumors of Tanintai IX being the most ruthless and disciplined ruler when it came to matters of the heart. While Saintana remained poised and unbothered, Jayranio couldn't shake his nerves. He was determined to put on a strong front for her sake, but he couldn’t stop thinking about what kind of diplomatic disaster might unfold if Tanintai was truly as enraged as they claimed.
        <br><br>
        Steeling himself, he followed Saintana into the meeting chamber, bracing for whatever was to come.</p>
