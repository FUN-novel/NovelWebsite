    <p>Saintana was seething, but she remained collected with her thoughts. Before reaching any conclusions, she tried to analyze the situation. However, Deaus might have already lost his chance—<b style="color: red;">the diary page lay wide open on the desk.  </b>
<br><br>
        The moment Saintana saw it, she shut the door and locked it from the inside. Without a second thought, <br>she grabbed Deaus by the neck and slammed him against the wall. One hand tightened around his throat, the other gripping his wrist with full force, ensuring he couldn't break free.  
        <br><br>
        Her voice was low, chilling—like the whisper of death itself. <b style="color: brown;">It was as if the Grim Reaper was speaking directly to him. </b> 
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: red;">"Who are you? Whose spy are you?" she hissed. "This is the first time I have failed to judge someone just by looking at them. I should have known something was off when you offered to serve me—without fear or greed."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Deaus struggled to breathe. If he didn't speak now, this would truly be his last day among mortals. He gasped out in a trembling voice,<br><br> <i style="color: blueviolet;">"Let… let me… explain… please… just hear me out… once!"</i>  
        <br>
        Saintana could have ended him right then and there, but doing so would ignite a diplomatic war—one that could expose her past to the world.  </p>

<div>
    <p>She loosened her grip slightly, <b style="color: red;">then tied him to a chair. </b> 
<br>  <br>
       <i style="color: aqua;"> "Don't even think about trying anything funny," she warned coldly. "That would be your last breath."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Deaus swallowed hard. <br> <i style="color: blueviolet;">"I… I had no bad intentions,"</i> he stammered.  
        <br><br>
        Saintana's eyes widened slightly. Deaus had never expected to see such an expression on her otherwise emotionless face.  
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: blueviolet;">"I was searching for you regarding the debut," he continued. "No one told me your room was off-limits." </i> 
        <br><br>
        Her gaze remained unreadable—she clearly wasn’t buying his excuse.  
        <br>
        Deaus hesitated before adding,<br><br> <i style="color: blueviolet;">"I knocked, but the door was open. I thought it wouldn’t hurt to take a look at the things my admirer possessed…"  
        </i><br><br>
        He was sweating now. <br> <i style="color: blueviolet;">"I was about to leave, but then… I saw the journal."</i>  
        <br><br>
        Saintana's aura darkened, her fist tightening.  
        <br>
        Deaus' voice faltered. <br> <i style="color: blueviolet;">"At first, I thought it was just a novel… I wanted to connect with you through a shared hobby. Please, believe me."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Saintana let out a slow, eerie laugh.  
        <br>
       <i style="color: aqua;"> "So, you're telling me," she said, stepping closer, "that it was just a coincidence that you opened exactly the page containing my deepest secret?" </i> 
        <br><br>
        Deaus' eyes lit up. <i style="color: blueviolet;">"Yes! Exactly!"</i> he blurted.  
        <br><br>
        <b style="color: red;">Saintana grabbed his jaw</b>, forcing him to look into her merciless gaze.  
        <br>
       <i style="color: aqua;"> "Do I look like a fool to you?" she asked. "Or have you simply forgotten what I did to the traitors two years ago?"  </i>
        <br><br>
        Everyone knew the story. A group of assassins, aided by the palace’s head maid, had attempted to kill Saintana in her own chambers. The next morning, the entire palace had woken to a gruesome sight—body parts scattered across the floors. The scene was so horrifying that even hardened warriors had vomited on the spot. But Saintana's eyes that day… they had searched for more violence.  </p>

<div>
    <p>Deaus began to cry like a child.  
<br><br>
        For a moment, Saintana saw a vision—<b style="color: khaki;">her love, crying at the sight of her wounds.  </b>
        <br><br>
        She stiffened.  
        <br>
        Why now, of all times?  
        <br>
        She took a step back, putting distance between them.  
       <i style="color: aqua;"> <br><br>
        "How much do you know?" she asked. "And what will you do if you make it out alive today?"  </i>
        <br><br>
        It was a test—a second chance that Deaus could not afford to lose.  
        <br><br>
        Instead of crafting a clever lie, he decided to speak from his heart. Fake words would only get him killed.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: blueviolet;">"I read almost everything," he admitted. "Who you were. Who he was. How you ended up in Saintara."  </i>
        <br>
        He hesitated. <br>
        <i style="color: blueviolet;"> "I still don’t understand where you mentioned your 'wasteful life of 2,000 years,' but that wasn't the point. While reading, I could feel it—your solitude. Your pain was deeper than any loss I’ve ever known."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Lowering his head, he continued, <br> <i style="color: blueviolet;">"I’m not saying this out of pity. You are far too great to be pitied by someone like me."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Saintana chuckled softly, murmuring to herself, <i style="color: aqua;">"Another one trying to turn me into some god-like figure… What more?"</i>  
        <br><br>
        Deaus couldn't hear her words, but he pressed on.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: blueviolet;">"But your story told me one thing—Saintana, even you can feel emotions. Emotions beyond anything ordinary people could comprehend."  </i>
        <br><br>
        For the first time, her expression softened.  
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: blueviolet;">"You lost, but that doesn’t mean you can't get back what was taken from you," he said firmly. "If he’s alive, I will help you find him. I have nothing to gain from this. If you don’t believe me, leave a spy to watch over me."  </i>
        <br><br>
        Saintana studied him carefully.  
        <br>
        <i style="color: aqua;">"I was hoping for a smarter answer,"</i> she said at last.  
        <br><br>
        Deaus' heart pounded. <b style="color: red;">Had he failed?  </b>
        <br><br>
        But then, without a word, she loosened his ropes and gestured toward the door.  
        <br><br>
        <i style="color: aqua;">"I know you won’t tell anyone," she said. "But don’t think I owe you an explanation for whatever is running through your mind."</i>  </p>
        <img src="./assets/zoneout.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<div>
    <p>She turned her back on him. <i style="color: aqua;">"Your words… they told me one thing,"</i> she muttered. <i style="color: aqua;">"If you’re telling the truth, then perhaps… there are still people in this world who expect nothing from me."</i>  
<br><br>
        Without another glance, she commanded him to leave and not show his face for some time.  
        <br>
        As the door shut behind him, Saintana locked herself in her room.  
        <br>
        She clutched the diary tightly to her chest, her fingers trembling.  
        <br>
        Then, without another thought, she reached for a bottle of alcohol—drinking until sleep finally claimed her.
