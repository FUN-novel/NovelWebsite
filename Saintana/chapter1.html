        Trumpets sounded—pepepe pe pepepe—followed by a thunderous wave of
        cheering and applause. The grand arena was alive with anticipation. This
        was no ordinary event; it was the competition of combat skills, a
        spectacle witnessed by the rulers of over ten empires. Each empire
        brought their champions, ready to display their strength and honor their
        unique cultures and etiquettes. At stake was not only the coveted title
        of the highest-ranking knight but also the rare privilege of training
        under <u>Saintana</u>, the sword master and the revered ruler who governed all
        ten empires with unmatched wisdom and strength.

            The empires were each gifted with a distinct magical affinity: fire, wind,
            water, earth, flora, vines, ice, weather, healing, and raw muscular
            strength. It mattered not if one was a commoner or an aristocrat, a man or
            a woman. Saintana herself, the epitome of strength and grace, stood as
            living proof that greatness transcends gender. A woman of unparalleled
            skill, she held the title of first citizen across the empires and
            commanded universal respect.

            This year, the tournament expanded to include
      participants from new empires wielding abilities of white magic, dark
      magic, and aura mastery. The stakes were higher than ever. The drum of
      commencement resounded, struck by Saintana herself, infusing the crowd
      with electrifying energy. <br><br>Round by round, contestants clashed, their
      numbers dwindling until only two remained: a weather manipulator and an
      aura master named Deaus. The final battle was intense, a dance of skill
      and raw power, but in the end, Deaus emerged victorious. The crowd erupted
      as Deaus approached the stage to receive his prize from Saintana. Yet,
      instead of gratitude, his arrogance got the better of him. Unaware of
      Saintana's true stature and blinded by his meteoric rise, he refused to
      accept the prize from her, citing her gender as a reason. In his
      ignorance, he claimed her position was due to favoritism from the rulers.
      His audacity silenced the arena, turning cheers into whispers of disbelief
      and outrage. The knight order moved to subdue him, but a commanding voice
      cut through the tension. It was Saintana, calmly accepting his challenge
      for a duel.

        <p> Who was Saintana? Why did everyone revere her? Why was she the
            highest authority, the one whose approval no ruler dared to act without?
            <br>To understand this, one must go back ten years. <br>Saintana first appeared
            in the Saintaira Empire, known for its healing magic, as a 19-year-old
            girl drenched in blood from head to toe. She had silver hair that
            shimmered like moonlight and piercing purple eyes. Her flawless, glossy
            skin, long lashes, and rosy lips marked her as a vision of beauty. Yet her
            cold, emotionless gaze sent shivers down spines. She was an enigma, a
            devil-like presence wrapped in human form. She revealed nothing of her
            past or the origin of the blood that covered her. But her actions spoke
            louder than words. She possessed knowledge far beyond anyone’s
            comprehension—advanced medicine, combat techniques that humbled the finest
            knights, and mastery over nature itself. Her capabilities seemed almost
            inhuman. Her speed rivaled that of a leopard, her vision as sharp as an
            eagle's, and her hearing unmatched. Some whispered she was the
            reincarnation of a devil, yet her warm demeanor toward commoners and her
            ability to mediate peace among nobles silenced even the harshest critics.
            Saintana’s contributions were unparalleled. She trained knights in
            advanced combat, brokered treaties, and brought prosperity wherever she
            went. Her brilliance and fairness earned her the unanimous approval of the
            ten empires, and at just 25 years old, she ascended to her position as the
            supreme ruler and protector of all. <br><br>

      <p>The Duel As Deaus stood before her,
        exuding arrogance, the crowd’s anticipation turned into a tense silence.
        Saintana, now 29 years old, stepped forward. Her silver hair glinted in
        the sunlight, her eyes cold and calculating. She did not raise her voice
        or display anger. Her presence alone silenced the whispers and reminded
        all who she was. “You have challenged me,” she said, her voice steady. <b><u><i>“I
          ACCEPT.”</i></u></b> The arena transformed into a battleground.</p>
