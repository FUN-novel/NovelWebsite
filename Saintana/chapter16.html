        <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">Night 2 of debut</b> <br><br>
            This time, everyone gathered in the grand hall not for a party but to satisfy their curiosity and witness the unfolding drama. Most were not here for truth or justice but for sheer entertainment. A sudden announcement commanded their attention:<br><br>

<b style="color: greenyellow;">"Now entering: Emperor Taintai IX, the esteemed Lady Saintana, Aide Rimika, and Crown Prince Jayranio of Quilientia."</b><br><br>

All eyes turned toward the group, their presence radiating power and authority. Amidst the murmurs, Emperor Himinnsa seized Jayranio's hand.<br><br>

<i style="color: gold;">"How much longer will you continue to disgrace me in front of everyone?"</i> he hissed.<br><br>

Jayranio frowned in anger, but before he could respond, Saintana stepped in. Seeing her stand before him, Himinnsa faltered for a moment before quickly composing himself.<br><br>

<i style="color: brown;">"It is an honor to be in your presence, Lady Saintana,"</i> he greeted her, attempting to feign humility. He hoped to divert her attention from the issue at hand, but he hadn't anticipated what came next.<br><br>

Saintana, without hesitation, took Jayranio by the hand and led him up the grand staircase to stand beside Taintai. Her act of protection made Jayranio blush, filling him with warmth, while Himinnsa continued to glare at his son as if he were an enemy.<br><br>

The crowd gathered below, eager to hear their explanation for the previous night’s events. Saintana stood tall and addressed them:<br><br>

<i style="color: aqua;">"I know many of you are curious about what transpired yesterday. I am here to clarify everything. Furthermore, I intend to unveil certain past crimes committed a decade ago."</i><br><br>

She turned her sharp gaze toward Himinnsa.<br><br>

<i style="color: aqua;">"First, let me introduce my soon-to-be husband, Jayranio, Crown Prince of Quilientia, an empire renowned for its mastery of aura."</i><br><br>

A wave of murmurs spread through the audience.<br><br>

From a distance, Deaus observed silently, while Amelia seized the opportunity to sit beside him, determined to use this event as a way to grow closer to him.<br><br></p>

    <p> <i style="color: aqua;">"Many of you are aware that I arrived in Saintara unexpectedly ten years ago. What you may not know is that I was fleeing a devastating fire that engulfed the mountain near Saintara—an incident unknown to most."</i><br><br>

        The Crown Prince of Flyrint spoke up. <br><i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"I recall now. One of our ministers once warned that the fire was unnatural. We had received no prior signs of an impending wildfire. However, during my father’s rule, the investigation was abruptly halted. Almost as if he was pressured into doing so."</i><br><br>
        
        Saintana smirked.<br><br>
        
        <i style="color: aqua;">"Indeed. And tonight, I shall expose the true face of Emperor Himinnsa."</i> She proceeded to reveal how Jayranio had nearly been killed in the fire—a tragedy orchestrated by Himinnsa himself.<br><br>
        
        Outraged, Himinnsa shouted, <i style="color: brown;">"What nonsense are you spewing, Lady Saintana? I respect you, but that does not give you the right to make baseless accusations without evidence."</i><br><br>
        
        Jayranio interjected, his voice firm. <i style="color: gold;">"What evidence is stronger than my testimony? I am living proof of what happened that night."</i><br><br>
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/burn.jpg" alt="">
   </div>
    <div>
       <p> Himinnsa scoffed. <br> <i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"You are still too naïve to understand how the law works."</i><br><br>

          Saintana’s smirk deepened, causing further unease among the crowd. She clapped her hands twice, signaling the entrance of several guards escorting a group of people into the hall.<br><br>
          
          <i style="color: aqua;">"Are these not the very individuals you hired to execute your heinous crime?"</i> she asked.<br><br>
          
          Himinnsa seethed. <i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"You are framing me!"</i><br><br>
          
          Saintana’s voice remained steady. <i style="color: aqua;">"Your empire has become so corrupt that mere coins can buy the loyalty of your own people. Suren, step forward."</i><br><br>
          
          Himinnsa’s fury erupted. <i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"You traitor!"</i><br><br>
          
          Suren met his gaze unfazed. <i style="color:cadetblue;">"I am not a traitor. I stand for what is right. Yesterday, for the first time in my life, I saw Lord Jayranio smile. And I refuse to let your greed take that away from him."</i><br><br>
          
          Jayranio was visibly moved by Suren’s words.<br><br>
          
          Suren continued, <i style="color: cadetblue;">"Everything Lady Saintana has said is true. I followed your orders back then, believing it was best for the empire. But now, I regret my foolishness."</i><br><br>
          
          The crowd’s whispers grew louder. Even Deaus looked shaken, his faith in his ruler crumbling. Sensing his distress, Amelia instinctively grabbed his hand, urging him to stay focused.<br><br>

    <div>
        <p>Before Saintana could respond, Musol interjected with a mocking tone. <i style="color: brown;">"What a fascinating turn of events! How conveniently Lady Saintana shifts the blame while covering up her own crimes."</i><br><br>
          
            Saintana arched an eyebrow, unimpressed. Jayranio, however, bristled with rage at hearing Musol utter her name so casually.<br><br>
            
            <i style="color: aqua;">"Speak clearly."</i> Saintana commanded.<br><br>
            
            Musol sneered. <i style="color: brown;">"You have exposed how Emperor Himinnsa orchestrated the fire. But tell me, how did you benefit from that tragedy? Why did you do nothing to stop it?"</i><br><br>
            
            His followers, sensing his folly, tried to silence him, but blinded by arrogance, he pressed on.<br><br>
            
            Saintana’s voice turned deadly. <i style="color: aqua;">"If you continue to speak in riddles, I will have your head displayed on the castle gates by dawn."</i><br><br>
            
            Musol swallowed hard. <i style="color: brown;">"Milli,"</i> he whispered.<br><br>
            
            Jayranio’s fury exploded. <i style="color: gold;">"Do not dare utter that name with your filthy mouth!"</i><br><br>
            
            Musol retrieved a charred heart-shaped pendant engraved with the name ‘Milli.’ <i style="color: brown;">"Do you recognize this?"</i> he taunted.<br><br>
            
            Saintana’s eyes widened. <i style="color: aqua;">"Where did you get that?"</i><br><br>
            
            Musol smirked. <i style="color: brown;">"Why does it matter? Are you trying to destroy evidence? I will tell everyone the truth—Lady Saintana is the real murderer!"</i><br><br>
            
            One of Musol’s closest allies attempted to slip away, but the guards blocked his escape.<br><br>
            
            Musol continued his rant. <i style="color: brown;">"You killed Milli to get your hands on Jayranio, using the fire to your advantage. But your plan failed because Jayranio got caught in the fire too. That’s why you seduced Emperor Taintai, manipulating him into granting you this position!"</i><br><br>
            
            Taintai and Jayranio unsheathed their swords simultaneously. Seeing Jayranio’s murderous glare, Musol stammered, <i style="color: brown;">"What lies has she whispered to turn you in favour of her?!"</i><br><br>
            
            The crowd was confused. Who was Milli?<br><br>
            
            Saintana, however, remained unfazed. <i style="color: aqua;">"My dear,"</i> she said sweetly, <i style="color: aqua;">"can you describe this ‘Milli’ you speak of?"</i><br><br>
            
            Jayranio smiled. <i style="color: gold;">"With pleasure! My Milli is one of a kind, an exceptional swordswoman. She has beautiful silver hair that shines like moonlight and royal purple eyes like the finest jewels. When those eyes look at me, my heart melts, and I cannot help but confess my love to her again and again..."</i><br><br>
            
            Taintai coughed. <i style="color: gray;">"Enough! You’re making us cringe."</i><br><br>
            
            Saintana blushed, and the crowd immediately pieced everything together. Musol, however, was still lost in his delusions.<br><br>
            
            Saintana ordered his imprisonment and demanded an investigation into his corruption. Desperate, Musol pleaded with the Emperor of Romancia. <i style="color: brown;">"My lord, I have served you loyally! Please help me!"</i><br><br>
            
            The emperor turned his back on him.<br><br>
            
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/musolend.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>With all truths revealed, Taintai stood and declared, <br> <i style="color: gray;">"I hereby order an official investigation into Emperor Himinnsa and his corrupt officers. Until further notice, he will be confined to his quarters under guard. Jayranio shall assume the throne of Quilientia. And one more announcement—Saintana and Jayranio’s wedding will take place in the coming months."</i><br><br>
          
            The hall erupted in cheers. Taintai smirked. <i style="color: gray;">"This wedding needs to happen soon. I can’t tolerate this lovesick couple any longer."</i><br><br>
            
            Laughter echoed throughout the room as everyone retired early, eager for the festivities of the final banquet night.</p>
