        <p><b style="font-size: 2em;">Night 2 of debut</b> <br><br>
            This time everyone gathered in the hall not for the party but to fill their curious eyes with amusement. Almost everyone was there for entertainment, not for facts and backstories. <br>
            Now an announcement attracted everyone's attention: <br> <i style="color: greenyellow;">"Now Emperor Taintai IX, Great Ruler Lady Saintana, Aide Rimika, and Crown Prince of Quilientia are entering."</i> <br><br>
            Everyone stared at the group, an aura of power and strength shining from them. Then, in between, Himinnsa grabbed Jayranio's hand. <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"How much longer are you going to shame me in front of all?"</i> <br><br>
            Jayranio frowned in anger, but Saintana stepped in. Seeing Saintana in front of him, Himinnsa flustered for a bit and greeted: <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"I am grateful to be in your presence, Great Lady Saintana."</i> <br><br>
            He thought buttering her up would make her leave the matter, but he didn't expect her to take Jayranio with her to the broad staircase near Taintai. Seeing her protect him made Jayranio blush and feel happy. Himinnsa was still staring at his son like an enemy. <br><br>
            Everyone started gathering near the staircase to hear their explanation for yesterday's event. <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"I know many of you are wondering about yesterday. I am here to clear everything."</i> <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"I am also going to solve some past mysteries or crimes that happened ten years ago."</i> <br><br>
            She said this while watching Himinnsa. <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"First, let me introduce my soon-to-be husband, Jayranio, the Crown Prince of Quilientia Empire, masters of aura."</i> <br><br>
            Everyone started whispering. Deaus was watching from afar while Amelia decided to occupy a seat near him, clearly wanting to get close. <br><br></p>

   <div>
    <p> <i style="color: aqua;">"As you know, I arrived in Saintara ten years ago unexpectedly after protecting myself from a huge fire in the mountains near Saintara. That incident may be unknown to many of you."</i> <br><br>
        The Crown Prince of Flyrint Empire spoke, <i>"I remember now. One of our ministers warned us that the fire was unnatural because we didn't get any prior signals of such an event. However, during my father's reign, the investigation was stopped, as if he was under pressure from someone."</i> <br><br>
        Saintana smirked. <br><br>
        <i style="color: aqua;">"Yes, so today, let me first reveal the true face of Emperor Himinnsa."</i> <br><br>
        She explained how Jayranio was nearly killed due to a fire caused by people under Himinnsa's orders. <br><br>
        <i style="color: brown;">"What nonsense are you spouting, Lady? I respect you, but that doesn't mean you can make baseless allegations without evidence."</i> <br><br>
        Jayranio interrupted: <br><br>
        <i style="color: gold;">"What evidence is stronger than my testimony? I am the living proof of that day's incident."</i> <br><br></p>

    <div>
        <p>Himinnsa laughed. <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"You are still too immature to understand how the law works!"</i> <br><br>
            Saintana smirked, confusing the crowd. She clapped her hands as a signal, and a guard brought some people inside the hall. <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"Are they not the ones you hired to commit that crime?"</i> <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"You are framing me!"</i> <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"Your empire has become so rotten that a few coins can buy the loyalty of your people."</i> <br><br>
            She pointed at Suren to step forward. <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"You traitor!"</i> <br><br>
            <i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"I am not a traitor; I stand with what is right. Yesterday, I saw Lord Jayranio smile for the first time in my life, and your greed won't take that smile away anymore."</i> <br><br>
            Jayranio was impressed by Suren. <br><br>
            <i style="color: cornflowerblue;">"Everything Lady Saintana said just now is true because I was the one who carried out the orders. I did it then, thinking it was best for His Highness Jayranio, but now I regret making such a foolish choice."</i> <br><br>
            The crowd whispered loudly, while Deaus was shocked to learn the dark truth about his ruler. Seeing Deaus flustered, Amelia unconsciously grabbed his hand and asked him to focus on the trial. <br><br></p>

        <p>Before Saintana could speak, Musol interrupted with his cunning voice: <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"Wow! What a truly beautiful turn of events. I can't believe how Lady Saintana covered her crimes by exposing Emperor Himinnsa's within a moment."</i> <br><br>
            Saintana raised an eyebrow, showing disinterest in such a foolish man, while Jayranio was filled with rage at hearing Saintana's name from such a foul mouth. <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"What do you mean? Speak clearly!"</i> <br><br>
            <i style="color: brown;">"You exposed how Emperor Himinnsa caused the mountain fire and attempted to murder the future heir, but you're not telling how you benefited from that incident!"</i> <br><br>
            Some of Musol’s followers sighed at his stupidity, realizing their investigation was worthless. Musol, full of greed, continued to dig his grave deeper. <br><br>
            <i style="color: aqua;">"If you speak in circles one more time, the whole capital will see your head hanging at the castle gate tomorrow."</i> <br><br>
            The tension in the hall rose as guards moved to detain Musol. <br><br>
            </p>

    <div>
        <p>Taintai stood up. <br><br>
            <i style="color: gray;">"I order a legal investigation against Emperor Himinnsa and his corrupt officers under the agreement of the other emperors of the Ten Empires. For now, Himinnsa will be under watch in his chambers, and Jayranio will take over the throne of Quilientia. And one more announcement—there will be a wedding ceremony for Saintana and Jayranio in the coming months!"</i> <br><br>
            The hall erupted in cheers. <br><br>
            <i style="color: gray;">"This wedding will be held soon so that I don’t have to deal with this cringy couple anymore!"</i> <br><br>
            Everyone laughed. That night, they retired early to prepare for the night market on the final day of the banquet.</p>
