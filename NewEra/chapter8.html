        <p><i>The arrival of that peculiar group in town wasn’t anything special. It was the month of visitors due to the annual festival. While Rowi was doing her best to keep her hair and eyes hidden from any suspicious gazes, the rest of the group enjoyed exploring the decorated streets and bustling vendor stalls. They booked an inn for a three-day stay and prepared for sightseeing. However, Rowi insisted on staying behind, citing illness.</i><br><br>

            <i>Sofi, concerned, offered to stay and take care of her, but Rowi refused bluntly, urging Sofi to enjoy herself with the others. Deep down, Rowi didn’t want Sofi to be bound to her forever, trapped in a future of uncertainty. Rowi herself didn’t know what lay ahead for her or even who she truly was anymore. But Sofi was just a normal person—a living being who had the right to be happy, to love, to get angry, to experience life in all its forms. Even though the thought ached Rowi’s heart, she forced herself to accept reality.</i><br><br></p>

    <p><i>Meanwhile, Braddy grew more suspicious of Rowi’s behavior in town. After everyone left, Rowi allowed herself to sink into a deep slumber.</i><br><br>

        <b>A Dream of the Unknown</b><br><br>
        
        <i>Rowana found herself floating on the surface of a vast, silent body of water. Only the sound of scattered droplets echoed around her. She took a few steps, her feet lightly touching the water, but suddenly, she fell into its depths. When she opened her eyes again, she was standing on an empty ground—pure white, stretching endlessly.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>A figure stood before her. The presence was overwhelming, suffocating… and yet strangely comforting. Rowi focused her gaze and saw a woman with the same golden eyes and black hair as her own.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>The woman wore a divine-looking red gown, its presence alone demanding attention. She murmured,</i> <b style="color:gold;">"You need to end this."</b><br><br>
        
        <i>Before Rowi could react, she awoke, drenched in sweat. It felt too vivid to be just a dream, yet she couldn’t decipher its meaning. Unable to rest, she decided to take a stroll outside, disguising herself with a cap and sunglasses to blend in.</i><br><br></p>

    <p><b>A Town Full of Secrets</b><br><br>

        <i>The rest of the group enjoyed the lively town market, though Sofi’s mind remained occupied with thoughts of Rowi. Joseph, as usual, tried to distract her with his flirtatious remarks, while Trish, ever the silent one, mostly communicated through small gestures with Lilli. Braddy, on the other hand, walked alone, uninterested in disturbing the two couples.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>As they strolled through the square, Braddy’s eyes landed on a newly made statue. The moment he recognized it, his heart skipped a beat. It was a statue of Rowana, the goddess of creation—Auriellia. It was recently painted.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>The golden eyes and black hair were identical to Rowi’s, though the face had been sculpted differently—no one truly knew what Rowana looked like, after all.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>Braddy wasn’t the only one who noticed. Trish, too, stared at the statue in realization. Sofi could already tell what was coming. Hiding the truth was no longer an option.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>The group’s eyes turned to Sofi, silently demanding an explanation.</i><br><br>
        
        <b style="color:gray;">"Can we wait until we return to the inn with Rowi?"</b><br><br>
        
        <i>Joseph nodded, and without another word, they all headed back.</i><br><br>
        
        <b>In the Shadows of a Pub</b><br><br>
        
        <i>Meanwhile, Rowi had chosen a pub as her place of gathering information. A pub was a perfect spot—where people of all kinds met, drank, and gossiped freely.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>After a few minutes, she overheard a conversation among a group of men.</i><br><br>
        
        Person1: <b style="color:lightblue;">"Have you heard? The famous acting troupe will be performing at the grand opening of the VIP temple exhibition."</b><br><br>
        
        Person2: <b style="color:lightgreen;">"Yeah, people are making a huge fuss about it. They’re acting as if the goddess herself will descend upon us."</b><br><br>
        
        Person1: <b style="color:lightblue;">"Why not? Maybe she’ll grace us with her presence."</b><br><br>
        
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"Oh yes, and then she’ll grant you three wishes, like a genie."</b><br><br>
        
        <i>They burst into laughter.</i><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"Greetings, gentlemen. Would you care for a drink on me?"</b><br><br>
        
        Person1: <b style="color:lightblue;">"A beautiful lady offering beer? Oh my, you must be charmed by us."</b><br><br>
        
        <i>Disgust twisted in Rowi’s stomach, but she played along.</i><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"Maybe… but I’m more interested in your conversation. I’m new here, and I find gossip quite fascinating."</b><br><br>
        
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"Tsk. We don’t care who you are, lady."</b><br><br>
        
        Person2: <b style="color:lightgreen;">"Don’t be rude to her. If a beauty offers a drink, accept it like a gentleman."</b><br><br>
        
        Person1: <b style="color:lightblue;">"You have a point. Sit here, my lady. By the way, what’s your name?"</b><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"It’s Trish."</b> <i>(Sorry, Trish…)</i><br><br>
        
        Person2: <b style="color:lightgreen;">"So, Trish, what kind of gossip are you interested in?"</b><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"I heard about an exhibition at the temple. Since I’m from far away, I’d like to experience everything before I leave."</b><br><br>
        
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"Tsk… only VIPs can enter for the first week before it opens to the public."</b><br><br>
        
        Person1: <b style="color:lightgreen;">"It’s an exhibition of the remains of Rowana’s cage—the one that was destroyed a few days ago. Surely, you’ve heard the legend of Rowana?"</b><br><br>
        
        <i>(Legend? Rowi thought bitterly. So now my destruction is a legend?)</i><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"Of course. So the temple is just using it to make money, huh?"</b><br><br>
        
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"Careful with your words. The temple is the most devoted and pure institution."</b><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"Oh? And yet you’re not suing me for blasphemy?"</b><br><br>
        
        <i>She had already assessed their mindset from their earlier jokes.</i><br><br>
        
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"Not everyone follows blindly. Their so-called devotion doesn’t benefit us." </b><br><br>
        
        Person1: <b style="color:lightgreen;">"Forget that, Trish. A beauty like you shouldn’t worry about these things. By the way, why are you wearing sunglasses indoors? Take them off."  
        </b><br><br>
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;">"I have an eye infection. It’s contagious."</b><br><br>
        
        Person2: <b style="color:lightgreen;">(laughs): "Then keep them on. But here’s something exclusive no one else will tell you."  
        </b><br><br>
        
        He leaned in, whispering, <b style="color:lightgreen;">"Most common folk know the temple is corrupt, but no one dares challenge them. There are rumors that they’re planning to create a new religion—one devoted solely to Rowana."  
          
        </b><br><br>
        Rowi froze for a moment. A religion?  <br><br>
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"If you’re done drinking, get lost. You ruined my leisure time." </b><br><br>
        Person 1 nudged him and apologized for his rudeness.
        
        Rowi: <b style="color:gold;"> (smiling): "It’s fine. But I must go now. It was a pleasure." </b><br><br>
        
        She turned and left swiftly.  
        <br><br>
        Person1: <b style="color:lightgreen;">"How gracefull she was, right!"
        </b><br><br>
        Person3: <b style="color:orange;">"May be I should ask the same question from your wife"
        </b><br><br>
        A shiver ran down Person 1’s spine, sending a wave of goosebumps across his skin.

    <p><b>Confrontation at the Inn</b><br><br>

        <i>Rowi rushed back to the inn, only to find the entire group waiting for her in her room.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>Sofi looked distressed.</i><br><br>
        
        <i>Rowi didn’t need to ask what had happened—she already knew. Their cover was about to be blown.</i><br></p>
