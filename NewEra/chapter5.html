    <p> Shelly was unaware of the strange feeling swelling in her chest. A tightness gripped her heart as she stood before the breathtaking sight. The immense floating figure of Rowana, wrapped in nature’s embrace, stirred something deep within her—a feeling of longing she couldn't explain.<br><br>

        With careful precision, she secured a rope and descended the cliff, her eyes scanning the landscape. Wild berries she had never seen before adorned the terrain, their colors vibrant and inviting. Flowers exuded remarkable fragrances, some familiar, others entirely unknown. She carefully gathered herbs, placing them in her bag for later study at her greenhouse.<br><br>
        
        As she moved closer to the towering figure of Rowana, an emotional storm raged inside her. The magnificent sight captivated her, but something beyond curiosity compelled her forward. Her hands gripped the thick, vein-like roots that extended from the structure, climbing with a sense of purpose beyond her own understanding. The closer she got, the stronger the emotions overwhelmed her.<br><br></p>

    <p>Finally, she reached the massive, nature-clad form and touched its surface. The moment her fingers brushed against it, tears welled up in her eyes. Her heart pounded uncontrollably as she moved near Rowana’s face—and to her shock, she saw that the statue’s eyes were wet too. It was as if Rowana herself could feel Shelly’s touch, as if her loneliness had found solace in that moment.<br><br>

        A mixture of awe and devastation filled Shelly. How could something so ancient, so revered, emanate such sorrow? She continued exploring and soon stumbled upon something unexpected—a hidden entrance.<br><br></p>

    <p><i>She murmured,</i> <b style="color:gray;">“No book, no story ever mentioned an entry in this cage…”</b><br><br>

        A part of her knew she should turn back, but a force beyond logic guided her forward. Inside, it was a world of its own—a lush, untouched jungle. The dense greenery wrapped around her, swallowing all sound but the rhythmic beating of her own heart. As she ventured deeper into the cage, her breath caught in her throat. At its core, she found something she had never expected.<br><br>
        
        There, sleeping peacefully, was a woman.<br><br>
        
        Not a structure. Not a legend. A real, living being.<br><br>
        
        Her eyes widened in disbelief. <b style="color:gray;">“It’s Rowana… The Rowana. The one from the legends. These black locks… the gift from the God of Creation.”</b><br><br>
        
        But something else caught her attention—Rowana’s fingers clutched a golden, glowing pearl. Shelly’s curiosity overpowered her hesitation. She reached out, her fingertips grazing the mysterious orb. The moment she made contact, a flood of memories surged into her mind—memories that did not belong to her.<br><br>
        Visions of Rowana’s past played before her eyes. A girl—Sofia—her dearest friend. Laughter, tears, an unbreakable bond… then pain, betrayal, suffering. It all unraveled like an unstoppable wave, crashing into Shelly’s consciousness.<br><br>

        Tears streamed down her cheeks. Her voice trembled.<br><br>
        
        <b style="color:gray;">“Rowana… No… Rowi… My dear friend… It—it’s because of me, isn’t it?”</b><br><br>
        
        Desperation clawed at her heart. The immense sorrow, the unbearable burden Rowana had endured—no, she couldn’t allow it.<br><br>
        
        She wouldn’t.<br><br>
        
        <b style="color:gray;">“I won’t let this continue,”</b> she whispered. <b style="color:gray;">“You deserve happiness… even if I have to fight the gods themselves.”</b><br><br>
        A newfound determination took hold of her. Clutching the pearl in her hand, she moved without understanding why—her body acting on instinct. She pressed the golden orb to Rowana’s forehead, and in an instant, a radiant golden light erupted, piercing the sky.<br><br></p>

        The entire world noticed.<br><br>
        
        Villagers gasped, their eyes drawn to the heavens. In distant cities, news spread like wildfire. The High Priest and temple authorities, who had long dismissed Rowana’s existence as mere myth, finally turned their attention toward the forbidden mountain.<br><br>
        
        Some people feared another catastrophe. Others believed it was a divine sign—a symbol of forgiveness.<br><br>
        
        But none of them truly knew.<br><br>
        
        At the epicenter of it all, Rowana’s eyes fluttered open for the first time in a thousand years. The golden glow in her gaze softened as she took in the sight before her. Her lips parted in a whisper.<br><br>
        
        <b style="color:gold;">“Sofia…?”</b><br><br>
        
        Yet, almost immediately, she realized—no, this wasn’t Sofia. The features were different, yet the tears in this girl’s eyes tugged painfully at Rowana’s heart.<br><br>
        Before either of them could process the moment, the cage around them began to collapse. Instinct took over. They ran as debris fell around them, dodging and weaving through the wreckage until they reached the ground.<br><br>

        A massive tremor shook the land, felt even in the farthest reaches of civilization. The once-floating structure was gone, and the world reeled in shock.<br><br>
        
        Rowana and Shelly lay amidst the remnants of the fallen cage, staring at each other in silence. Rowana took in Shelly’s features—brown hair, black eyes. She wasn’t Sofia. Yet… she was.<br><br>
        
        She hesitated. A painful memory surfaced—once before, someone had pretended to be Sofia, deceiving her trust. But this… this was different. This soul, the warmth, the familiarity—it was unmistakable.<br><br>
        
        With a trembling hand, she caressed Shelly’s face, a bittersweet smile gracing her lips.<br><br>
        
        <b style="color:gold;">“You’re alive… Thank you.”</b><br><br>
        
        Confusion clouded Shelly’s thoughts. Two sets of memories—her own and Sofia’s—warred within her mind. Who was she? What was happening?<br><br>
        
        Rowana gently cradled her head. <b style="color:gold;">“Close your eyes.”</b><br><br>
        
        A strange sensation coursed through Shelly, a fusion of warmth and cold intertwining within her. Clarity began to take shape.<br><br>
        
        She understood.<br><br>
        
        Sofia and Shelly—two names, two bodies, but one soul.<br><br>
        
        A soft smile broke across her face, and without hesitation, she embraced Rowana. Tears flowed freely as they held each other, reunited at last.<br><br>

    <p>
        But their moment of peace was fleeting.<br><br>The sound of footsteps—many footsteps—approached. The distant hum of drones filled the air.<br><br>

        They were being watched.<br><br>
        
        Without a word, Rowana grabbed Shelly’s hand, and they ran. Deeper into the dense forest, away from prying eyes. Away from the chaos unfolding in the world beyond.<br><br></p>

<div>
    <p>High above, the gods watched in silence.<br><br>

        The God of Peace smiled. <i>“Finally… It was the right choice to let Sofia’s soul reincarnate.”</i><br><br>
        
        The God of Nature nodded. <i>“It was the only way to atone for our sins against Rowana.”</i><br><br>
        
        The God of Creation remained quiet, observing the unfolding events with keen interest. And then, a smirk.<br><br>
        
        <i style="color: red;">“Things are about to get interesting.”</i></p>
